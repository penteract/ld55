PRIORITIES:
- stats on death
- intro
- restart button on death
- Anything that makes what's happening clearer
 - Don't show names most of the time?

- basic AI

- Final polish:
Reduce timer to 5 seconds (or shorter; perhaps run multiple servers at different speeds)
Do something about players that disconnect ("looking for a fight" sometimes being able to find people waiting/hiding would fix this)
Consider persisting name and truename in localStorage




// Make clickng on any action do something

Get animations
 //- show shots from demons that successfully shoot
 - make the result of a battle clear
   - Make a log of events that affect you
     - result of your action (unless the action is wait)
     - any movement
     - result of any fight that ends (concession or one side being empty (killed or summoned away))

Handle Game Over appropriately:
 //don't just 400
 report kills, wins, age, debts



Get animations working properly
  //- track what happens on the server side
    // - fix summons so that they appear in the right places (create placeholders that exist within the linked list)
       //- - summoning circles have been added to track this - check they're handled correctly (only last for the turn they're supposed to etc)
  - make shots hit the right targets while summoning attempts are made and deaths occur;
    //   then animate summons (animate horizontal shrinking+growing; consider how to manage fizzles)
  - death animations; health reduction when hit
  - design some animations (possibly use an actual image editor rather than relying on canvas commands)

Rendering
 - consider dynamically scaling fights to fit the number of participants

 - client should display debts owed somewhere 

Graphics
 - Are we seriously going to leave our demons as 3 circles?
 - Add some intersting terrain scorch marks and/or bloodstains (particularly in long running battles if we want to persist enough)
Audio?

Consider changing the rules/strategy
  There are many things we could do here but it's not a priority until we can see more about how the game plays.
  Multiple enemies per fight?
  healing on kill? healing on successful hide?
  score - wins, kills, influence

Better AI:
  key info in fight: demons in front, demons behind, demons on enemy side.
  if k*front is more than enemies, don't surrender (you'll probably be able to surrender next turn).
  if front is more than enemies, fire (no reason to waste favours)
  if your side is losing, try to escape (accept requests)

Prepare and submit the game
  - Screenshots
  //- add authors on ldjam.com (we need to Follow each other)
  - Title "You can be summoned"


  BUGS:
  without accepting invitations being implemented, hrechnexgraw ended up able to summon something. (not a bug; could have been caused by opponent's concession)
  Display the fight associated with the summoner, not the fight the summoner is currently in?
