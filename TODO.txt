// Make clickng on any action do something

Get animations
 - show shots from demons that successfully shoot
 - make the result of a battle clear

Handle Game Over appropriately:
 don't just 400
 report kills, wins, age, debts

Get animations working properly
  - track what happens on the server side
    // - fix summons so that they appear in the right places (create placeholders that exist within the linked list)
       - - summoning circles have been added to track this - check they're handled correctly (only last for the turn they're supposed to etc)
  - make shots hit the right targets while summoning attempts are made and deaths occur;
       then animate summons (animate horizontal shrinking+growing; consider how to manage fizzles)

  - design some animations (possibly use an actual image editor rather than relying on canvas commands)

Rendering
 - consider dynamically scaling fights to fit the number of participants

 - client should display debts owed somewhere 

Audio?

Consider changing the rules/strategy
  There are many things we could do here but it's not a priority until we can see more about how the game plays.

Prepare and submit the game
  - Screenshots
  //- add authors on ldjam.com (we need to Follow each other)
  - Title "You can be summoned"


  BUGS:
  without accepting invitations being implemented, hrechnexgraw ended up able to summon something. (not a bug; could have been caused by opponent's concession)
