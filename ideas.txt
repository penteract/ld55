Summoning - Turn based strategy
 - Where were the things summoned from? can they be summoned away from you? Do they arrive at full health?
It spreads, Decay, collapse - reach a goal on a grid while avoiding probabilisic corruption (king moves avoiding knight moves?)
Recycle, strange machine - spacechem with irrational numbers and without the layout questions
Strength in numbers, you don't play as the main char - choose stats for a character which fights without much input from you
  - get a new random char every time (different weapons?) so optimal build isn't the same every time)
    - pick up gear as you go
  - int makes player pick better options
  - spd detrimental
  - 
Tunnels, cartography? - 4D maze
Fishing - Phishing, finding K-trees ???
